* Transforming values into columns with dummy variables for training and testing the models
* Creating Multiple Predicting models for predicting the rate of a movie based on original_language, spoken_languages, production_countries, genres 
* Creating models such as : Logistic Regression, KNN, Native Bayes, Decision Tree, Ada Boosting, Random Forest, Gradient Boosting, XGBClassifier
* Comparing the Accuracy of the models
